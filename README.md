# beauty-salon-management-system
This project is a management system for a beauty salon developed using Windows Forms. Users can add and remove new customers, assign services with specific dates, view the total cost of the added services, and list approved services. The system provides a user-friendly interface for effective salon management.

## Notes
This project was developed as the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course in the second semester of my 1st year at Sakarya University.
